Do you want your improv scenes to look like masterful comedy sketches?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop description:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this two-day workshop, Tamar will introduce you to the core components of premise improv. You’ll learn how to pull an idea from a monologue and use it to initiate an improv scene, how to discover and play game with your scene partner, how to invest in the choices you and your partner make and maximise their potential and how to play believable, committed characters that you could see in a sitcom!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="workshop" /><category term="workshop" /><summary type="html">Do you want to be able to pull ideas from an opening and use them to initiate scenes?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A new life!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/new_life" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A new life!" /><published>2021-09-30T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-09-30T20:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/new_life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new_life">&lt;p&gt;The mushrooms are back on 2021!

&lt;p&gt;Our impro fight will set two impro groups face to face on stage and make them compete for more applause from the audience. You give us the suggestions and you vote for the troupe that gets the points!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time Don’t Touch My Mushroom will face the ETH based group Dodecahedron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you get &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;your tickets&lt;/a&gt; beforehand. &lt;strong&gt;There are limited spaces!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-we-charge-for-tickets&quot;&gt;Why do we charge for tickets?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to COVID-19, we had to follow some regulations. One of them is limiting the audience to maximum 50 people and another is having everyone’s contact information (i.e. telephone number). For that the easiest and fastest solution was using a ticketing platform.  We decided to set a minimum price in order to make sure people would come to the show after having reserved a ticket. The money that is collected will be used to pay for the room and the rehearsal premises.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="show" /><category term="show" /><summary type="html">This show has been cancelled due to COVID19.

&lt;p&gt;Team against team – improviser against improviser – Titan against Titan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The home team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zurichimprovcomedy.ch/&quot;&gt;Zurich Improv Comedy (ZIC)&lt;/a&gt;, competes in each show against a different improv group from Switzerland. The two teams improvise scenes based on audience suggestions. It is also the audience’s task to assign points to them – so YOU are in charge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fast-paced comedy theater – spontaneous, entertaining, interactive, engaging and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

The first one is Stephen Thornton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop description:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s so easy to get carried away with dialogue onstage. I’m sure we have all been there. Where we start talking and just keep going; because one idea gives way to another then another. We speak, giving out massive amounts of information. As a by-product we are also giving our partner multiple offers. Now, our partner has to make a choice as to which offer they want to go with. The choice they make might not be the one that you were wanting to explore. In this workshop we will work on delivering ONE offer at a time. One offer allows you and your partner to stay on the same page and explore what the scene is about in a deeper, clearer way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoom link will be sent to participants via email.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="workshop" /><category term="workshop" /><category term="online" /><summary type="html">No virus is going to keep us from doing Improv!

&lt;p&gt;Having a clear vision of your environment, the objects and furnitures that are around, the size and weight of the mimes you use, is an helpful friend to make your stories more true to you, your partners and the audience. It helps you react in a more consistent way, more grounded to the reality of your scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this workshop we will train our bodies to play truly in our imaginary environments, to make them more visible to us and the audience. It finds its inspiration in Lecoq’s work, clown, commedia dell’arte.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="workshop" /><category term="workshop" /><summary type="html">This workshop focuses on a side-skill : miming and object and space work.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mushrooms on Stage</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mushroom-on-stage" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mushrooms on Stage" /><published>2020-02-20T20:00:01+00:00</published><updated>2020-02-20T20:00:01+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mushroom-on-stage</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mushroom-on-stage">&lt;p&gt;Improv is what happens when the actors don’t know what will happen: A totally spontaneous spectacle, made up on the spot and based on suggestions from the audience members!

&lt;!--more--&gt;
First, Don’t Touch My Mushroom Improv will play their new improvised format “The Gathering” for the first time ever. It’s a show about a dramatic, life changing event, gathering friends and enemies, envious colleagues and backstabbing family, secret lovers and open haters. What happens at this event is a mystery to all of us. But we will find out together in “The Gathering”! With the musical support of Klearjos Papanicolaou.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait there’s more! The Basic Pitches, the one and only musical improv group of Zurich, will then take the stage and will perform a fully improvised musical with all its extravaganza: Singing, dancing, drama and comedy! This is their third show ever and after two grandiose shows at Theater Ida, they are playing for the first time in the city at Jenseits! With the musical support of Izaskun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="show" /><category term="show" /><summary type="html">In this very special double feature, we present two unique improv shows in one fantastic night.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ida Theatersport Liga</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Ida_04-2022" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ida Theatersport Liga" /><published>2022-04-29T19:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-29T19:30:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Ida_04-2022</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Ida_04-2022">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theaterida.ch/&quot;&gt;Theater Ida&lt;/a&gt; is organizing a theater sports liga with shows in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theater Ida presents the Ida Theatersport Liga. 2 teams will compete with the weapons of improvisation theatre. The audience and jury decide and award the points.

&lt;p&gt;The home team, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zurichimprovcomedy.ch/&quot;&gt;Zurich Improv Comedy (ZIC)&lt;/a&gt;, competes in each show against a different improv group from Switzerland. The two teams improvise scenes based on audience suggestions. It is also the audience’s task to assign points to them – so YOU are in charge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fast-paced comedy theater – spontaneous, entertaining, interactive, engaging and fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will ask the audience to come up with “memory triggers” to help our “patients” throughout their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the show will be short form improv games that you all know and love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="show" /><category term="show" /><summary type="html">An improvised play based on a game where characters will try to recover their lost memories.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Open Stage + a penny for my thoughts @ Dynamo</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/dynamo" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Open Stage + a penny for my thoughts @ Dynamo" /><published>2022-03-23T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-23T20:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/dynamo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/dynamo">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tobertushabicht.ch/&quot;&gt;Tobertus Habicht&lt;/a&gt; invited us to their open stage and to premiere our new format “a penny for my thoughts”.

&lt;p&gt;This is an english evening: In the first half there is an open stage: come, watch or jump on stage with us, you decide! We play our (and your?) favourite short-form games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second half, we will premiere “a penny for my thoughts” an improvised play  based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.orphicinstitute.com/&quot;&gt;a game&lt;/a&gt; where characters will try to recover their lost memories.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="show" /><category term="show" /><category term="guest" /><summary type="html">Tobertus Habicht invited us to their open stage and to premiere our new format “a penny for my thoughts”.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PREMISE + GAME in IMPROV SCENES</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tamar-broadbent" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PREMISE + GAME in IMPROV SCENES" /><published>2021-12-04T10:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-04T10:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tamar-broadbent</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tamar-broadbent">&lt;p&gt;Do you want to be able to pull ideas from an opening and use them to initiate scenes?&lt;!--more--&gt; Do you fancy yourself as having a ‘writer’s brain’ and want to channel that to make your scenes even stronger?

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workshop-description&quot;&gt;Workshop description:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this two-day workshop, Tamar will introduce you to the core components of premise improv. You’ll learn how to pull an idea from a monologue and use it to initiate an improv scene, how to discover and play game with your scene partner, how to invest in the choices you and your partner make and maximise their potential and how to play believable, committed characters that you could see in a sitcom!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="workshop" /><category term="workshop" /><summary type="html">Do you want to be able to pull ideas from an opening and use them to initiate scenes?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A new life!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/new_life" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A new life!" /><published>2021-09-30T20:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-09-30T20:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/new_life</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new_life">&lt;p&gt;The mushrooms are back on 2021!

    This show has been cancelled due to COVID19.
  &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will see you on stage again in 2021!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our impro fight will set two impro groups face to face on stage and make them compete for more applause from the audience. You give us the suggestions and you vote for the troupe that gets the points!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time Don’t Touch My Mushroom will face the ETH based group Dodecahedron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you get &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;your tickets&lt;/a&gt; beforehand. &lt;strong&gt;There are limited spaces!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-we-charge-for-tickets&quot;&gt;Why do we charge for tickets?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to COVID-19, we had to follow some regulations. One of them is limiting the audience to maximum 50 people and another is having everyone’s contact information (i.e. telephone number). For that the easiest and fastest solution was using a ticketing platform.  We decided to set a minimum price in order to make sure people would come to the show after having reserved a ticket. The money that is collected will be used to pay for the room and the rehearsal premises.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;facebook&quot;=&gt;&quot;donttouchmymushroom&quot;}</name></author><category term="show" /><category term="show" /><summary type="html">This show has been cancelled due to COVID19.

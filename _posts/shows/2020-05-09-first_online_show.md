No virus is going to prevent us from doing what we like most! Don't Touch My Mushroom adapts to the circumstances and brings us a fully online improv show experience.<!--more-->
We might face a pandemic, technical difficulties and a confinement, but we hope we can bring a smile to your face when you need it most.
Join us for 30 minutes of our first attempt on virtual Improv. Let us spend part of our confinement together!

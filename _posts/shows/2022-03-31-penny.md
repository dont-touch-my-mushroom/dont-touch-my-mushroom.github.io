An improvised play based on [a game](https://www.orphicinstitute.com/) where characters will try to recover their lost memories.
<!--more-->

We will ask the audience to come up with "memory triggers" to help our "patients" throughout their journey.

The first half of the show will be short form improv games that you all know and love.

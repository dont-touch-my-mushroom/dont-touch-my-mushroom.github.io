Watch the Mushrooms at improvise at [Theater Ida](https://www.theaterida.ch/) with a new long form improvised: The Stranger.

<!--more-->

Meet a tight knit community facing a mysterious challenge when a stranger arrives. Who are those people? What is their secret? Who is that stranger for goodness sake? We all do not know. But we will find out together with the audience. Strange times.

This is the new long form improvised format of Donâ€™t touch my mushrooms at Theater Ida in English.

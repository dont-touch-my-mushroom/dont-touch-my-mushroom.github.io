Join us to laugh with and at one of the few (and therefore one of the best!) Zurich’s international improv theatre troupes, Don’t Touch My Mushroom. Once again, the fungi’s show will be unscripted, unpredictable, unhinged, and inspired by you, the audience.

You will not walk out smarter, but you will walk out happier.
<!--more-->
This show is based on jenseits’ seasonal theme, «Be at Home.» Do you wonder what that means for a mushroom? No worries, the players also do not know! They will make sense of it and invent (un)believable stories in front of your eyes, helped by your suggestions and their random thoughts (if they have any). All of this sprinkled with a variety of foreign accents!

Time: 20:00 until ca. 21:30 Uhr

Entrance fee: pay what you want

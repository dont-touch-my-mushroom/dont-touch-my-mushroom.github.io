Dear friends & improv friends,

The brand new *Don't Touch My Mushroom* show has arrived!
<!--more-->
Returning to the friendly location of **jenseits im Viadukt** we will improvise
unique stories to make you laugh, cry and think!

Drinks are sold at the bar before the show and during the break. You are also
very welcome to stay for a drink and a chat with the talented Mushrooms - but
remember: Don't Touch!

The show is in English. Please register also through
[the jenseits event page](http://jenseitsimviadukt.ch/event/dont-touch-my-mushroom-the-fungus-returns/).

Looking forward to seeing you on February 27th - the fun starts at 20:00!

The Harold is a longform improvised format which emphasises patterns, themes and group discoveries instead of a traditional plot or story. Everything starts from a simple suggestion from the audience.

The **Game** of the scene is not predetermined. We create Games and their rules in the moment.

Doors open at 19:50. Show duration 20:00 - 22:00.

Please make sure you get [your tickets]({{ticket_url}}) beforehand. **There are limited spaces!**

# Why do we charge for tickets?

Due to COVID-19, we had to follow some regulations. One of them is limiting the audience to maximum 50 people and another is having everyone's contact information (i.e. telephone number). For that the easiest and fastest solution was using a ticketing platform.  We decided to set a minimum price in order to make sure people would come to the show after having reserved a ticket. The money that is collected will be used to pay for the room and the rehearsal premises.

# Why do we charge for tickets?

Due to COVID-19, we had to follow some regulations. One of them is limiting the audience to maximum 50 people and another is having everyone's contact information (i.e. telephone number). For that the easiest and fastest solution was using a ticketing platform.  We decided to set a minimum price in order to make sure people would come to the show after having reserved a ticket. The money that is collected will be used to pay for the room and the rehearsal premises.

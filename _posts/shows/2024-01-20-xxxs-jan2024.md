Stories about love and the end of it<!--more-->, inspired by expartners from the audience.

This show on January 20th specifically will be an experimental alternative proposal as you have never seen improv before. Not on a stage but very close to the improvisers walking as spectators through different rooms. A vouyeristic tour through the intimacy of peopleâ€™s spaces. 

Something important to consider is that audience will be standing up through the show and due to the concept, only limited spaces are available, previous reservation through eventfrog is needed. 

This show is on donation basis. Reservation is 10chf and you can give more if you want after the show. 

Come and immerse into the intimacy of these characters.

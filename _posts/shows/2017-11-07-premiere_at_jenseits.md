The Improv Group *Don't Touch My Mushroom* is proud... and slightly scared... to
announce its first independent show in English!
<!--more-->
In a friendly atmosphere of Viadukt, we will perform some well-known and some
less so well-known improv games and try to make your face shine with a smile
throughout one dark November evening.

Drinks will be sold at a bar. Some small snacks will be provided on spot too.

Looking forward to seeing you on November 7th - the fun starts at 20:00!

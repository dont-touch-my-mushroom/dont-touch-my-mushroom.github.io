[Zurich Improv Comedy (ZIC)](https://www.zurichimprovcomedy.ch/) is organizing a theater sports show and they invited us to participate.

Team against team – improviser against improviser – Titan against Titan!

The home team, [Zurich Improv Comedy (ZIC)](https://www.zurichimprovcomedy.ch/), competes in each show against a different improv group from Switzerland. The two teams improvise scenes based on audience suggestions. It is also the audience’s task to assign points to them – so YOU are in charge!

It’s fast-paced comedy theater – spontaneous, entertaining, interactive, engaging and fun!

Come and see it first hand to fully experience and appreciate the magic of creating theater on the spot.

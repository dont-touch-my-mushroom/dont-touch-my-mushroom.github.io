Join us to laugh with and at one of the few (and therefore one of the best!) Zurich's international
improv theatre troupe: The Don't Touch my Mushroom team.<!--more--> Once again, the fungi’s show will be unscripted,
unpredictable, unhinged, and inspired by you, the audience. You will not walk out smarter, but you will
walk out happier. You might also learn some alternative facts created out of your suggestions and of
the players’ random neuron connections. All of this sprinkled with a variety of foreign accents!

The show is in English. Also see

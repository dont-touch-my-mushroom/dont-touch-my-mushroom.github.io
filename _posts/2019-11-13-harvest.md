Improv is what happens when the actors donâ€™t know what will happen: A totally spontaneous spectacle, made up on the spot and based on suggestions from the audience members!

Thanksgiving can be the land of any inspiration. Come for a fantastical time full of unexpected surprises. You give us suggestions and we create the story.

instructor_review: "Jon is a perfect organizer, I had all the information needed in time, and he's very reactive. It's awesome, I could completely focus on the teaching and not worry about anything else. His community is open, fun, and warm-welcoming. It was a pleasure to meet them =)"
instructor_bio: "Cédric has been playing and teaching improv in different companies in Strasbourg (France), he's a member and co-founder of La Carpe Haute. La Carpe Haute could be described as explosive, sincere, physical and silly. He loves miming, clowning and playing with the body, that's what he wants to bring in his performances and workshops."

This workshop focuses on a side-skill : miming and object and space work.<!--more-->

Having a clear vision of your environment, the objects and furnitures that are around, the size and weight of the mimes you use, is an helpful friend to make your stories more true to you, your partners and the audience. It helps you react in a more consistent way, more grounded to the reality of your scene.

In this workshop we will train our bodies to play truly in our imaginary environments, to make them more visible to us and the audience. It finds its inspiration in Lecoq's work, clown, commedia dell'arte.

No virus is going to keep us from doing Improv! Now that most of us are secluded at home we should adapt and do things that keep us sane.<!--more--> I would go insane without improv and so we decided to contact international improvisers to give us workshops through VC. The first one is Stephen Thornton.

### Workshop description:

It’s so easy to get carried away with dialogue onstage. I’m sure we’ve all been there. Where we start talking and just keep going; because one idea gives way to another then another. We speak, giving out massive amounts of information. As a by-product we are also giving our partner multiple offers. Now, our partner has to make a choice as to which offer they want to go with. The choice they make might not be the one that you were wanting to explore. In this workshop we will work on delivering ONE offer at a time. One offer allows you and your partner to stay on the same page and explore what the scene is about in a deeper, clearer way.

**Zoom link will be sent to participants via email.**

instructor_review: "Jon is a perfect organizer, I had all the information needed in time, and he's very reactive. It's awesome, I could completely focus on the teaching and not worry about anything else. His community is open, fun, and warm-welcoming. It was a pleasure to meet them =)"
instructor_bio: "Cédric has been playing and teaching improv in different companies in Strasbourg (France), he's a member and co-founder of La Carpe Haute. La Carpe Haute could be described as explosive, sincere, physical and silly. He loves miming, clowning and playing with the body, that's what he wants to bring in his performances and workshops."

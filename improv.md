# Do you want to do some improv?

We are organizing roughly biweekly open sessions -- everyone with some Improv
experience is welcome.

{:.heading-title}
## How to join?

{:.orderlist}
1. Join our mailing list
  [improv-zurich](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/improv-zurich/join).
1. Introduce yourself informally. A "Hi" is fine, but you can go fancy ;)
1. Check for emails to make sure the session is happening.
1. Show up.

## Where is it?

See [this
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjFeCMlUWh2jRm9GhoPKZgfebrwNkwBnoqoO1Poz_W8/edit?usp=sharing)
for an illustrated guide.

## How much does it cost?

Payment is absolutely optional. That said, we appreciate
donations towards the room rent from everyone who can afford it and enjoys the
session -- e.g. CHF 10.

We might change this if this doesn't work out but so far it is looking good.

## When is it?

The sessions take place from **19:00 until 21:00**.

# Do you want to do some improv?

We are organizing roughly biweekly open sessions -- everyone with some Improv
experience is welcome.

  <p>We are cancelling all Thursday sessions until further notice. We will send an announcement email to
  the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/improv-zurich/join">improv-zurich mailing group</a>
  as soon as we know when we can resume them.</p>

## How to join?

{:.orderlist}
1. Join our mailing group
  [improv-zurich](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/improv-zurich/join).
1. Introduce yourself informally. A "Hi" is fine, but you can go fancy ;)
1. Check for emails to make sure the session is happening.
1. Show up.

## Where is it?
Kindertreff Viadukt (look for the place with number ...16) 

## How much does it cost?

Payment is absolutely optional. That said, we appreciate
donations towards the room rent from everyone who can afford it and enjoys the
session -- e.g. CHF 10.

We might change this if this doesn't work out but so far it is looking good.

## When is it?

The sessions take place from **19:00 until 21:30**.

**Please make sure that we sent an email announcing that the session will take place.**
